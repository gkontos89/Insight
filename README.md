Application for loading and viewing movie collections.
My goal for this project is to build a viewing application for people
with harddrives of downloaded movies.  My friend has tons of movies
on a harddrive in folders and he'd like to parse through them all and store a
lightweight database to see his collection.

The folder structure is:

->root
	->genre
		->letter
			->movie1
			...
			
ie.

->movies
	->Action
		->A
			->movie1
			->movie2
			...
		->B
			->movie3
			->movie4
			...
	->Crime
		->A
			->movie5
			->movie6
			...
		->B
			->movie7
			->movie8
			...
	->Drama
		->A
			->movie9
			->movie10
			...
		->B
			->movie11
			->movie12
			...
